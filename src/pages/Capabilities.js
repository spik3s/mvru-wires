							Access to endemic areas allow us to be as close to

						</p>

						<h4>Field Laboratories</h4>
						<p>
							Our field laboratories are situated in the midst of
							Thailand’s endemic areas. They offer unique
							opportunities to experiment with live P. vivax
							parasites. These labs enable short-term in vitro
							culture, sophisticate sample processing, and
							mosquito infection experiments. They are excellent
							teaching grounds for students and great retreat
							sites for investigators!
						</p>

						<h4>Access to vivax-infected blood</h4>

						<p>
							Because P. vivax cannot be maintained and propagated
							in culture, malaria patients or infected carriers
							are the only sources of live parasites for research.
							Working with malaria clinic and local hospitals, we
							have established access to patients in endemic areas
							throughout Thailand. Since 2011, our teams have been
							deployed to the Thai-Myanmar, Thai Cambodian, and
							Southern regions to collect fresh parasites. With
							the technical and logistical knowhow, we have
							achieved and can provide reliable mosquito infection
							and short-term blood stage parasite culture for
							malaria research.
						</p>
						<h4>Field Research</h4>
						<p>
							Field studies are necessary for closing the
							knowledge gap in malaria epidemiology and
							transmission. With over 30 years of experience in
							conducing field studies in Thailand, we have tackled
							and handled logistical and ethical challenges in
							various research activities. Different protocols -
							cross sectional surveys, cohort studies, passive
							case detections, follow ups, human landing capture
							of mosquitoes - have been successfully implemented
							in various sites in the country.
