							MVRU is a major unit of the Malaria Excellence
							Centre of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol
							University. Founded in 2011 under the leadership of
							Dr. Jetsumon Sattabongkot, the MVRU has grown from 8
							staff to over 30 currently. With full access to
							Mahidol University facilities and supporting
							infrastructure, including well equipped field
							laboratories in malaria endemic sites, MVRU has
							established itself as a leader in Plasmodium vivax
							research. The unit has attracted many international
							research supports aiming to drive malaria
							elimination.

							MVRUâ€™s mission is to accelerate malaria elimination
							through research. To achieve our goal, we strive to
							fill important knowledge gaps in P. vivax biology as
							well as to provide platforms for development of new
							diagnostic and therapeutic tools. MVRU staff work
							both in the field and in the lab to discover,
							create, and validate new ways to fight malaria.
						</p>
						<p>
							Working closely with both community leaders in the
							endemic areas of Thailand and leading international
							scientists, we have built a strong collaborative
							network to support frontier research in vivax
							malaria. Population-based studies (social and
							epidemiological) have been a major part of our
							research to advance understanding of risk factors,
							trends of infection, and impacts of different
							interventions.
						</p>
						<p>
							Fresh P. vivax parasites from patients and
							asymptomatic carriers have allowed us and
							collaborators to investigate the biology of all
							stages of the parasite. With our high-quality
							colonies of Anopheline mosquitos, we can study of
							malaria transmission in the well-controlled
							laboratory settings. Our high-capacity production of
							female An. dirus have also made possible studies of,
							and drug screening against, the elusive liver-stage
							parasites including hypnozoites.

							MVRU research activities have been supported by Bill
							and Melinda Gates Foundation, US-NIH, US-DoD,
							Wellcome Trust, Korea-NIH, and GHIT. Our
							achievements and commitment to research are
							reflected in continuous international fundings as
							well as in peer-reviewed publications. Our
							investigators serve on several international
							scientific boards and committees.
						</p>
						<p>
							Within the next 5 years, we will put our best effort
							to provide a better understanding malaria
							transmission, develop new transmission blocking
							vaccines for P. vivax, evaluate novel interventions,
							validate new diagnostic tools, and close key
							knowledge gaps in P. vivax biology related to the
							parasite dormancy and population reservoir.
